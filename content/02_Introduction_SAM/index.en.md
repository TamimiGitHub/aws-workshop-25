## Problem statement
Building effective agentic systems presents a complex challenge that extends far beyond simply deploying AI models. AI Agents are siloed systems that operate in isolation, and are unable to effectively communicate or share capabilities across organizational boundaries. **By definition and design, Agents are inherently domain-specific, designed to excel in narrow use cases but struggling to collaborate or leverage expertise from other specialized agents, creating fragmented AI ecosystems that fail to realize their collective potential.**

To make intelligent decisions and respond to dynamic conditions, agentic systems must rely on event-driven actions that flow into the organization. While solving the core AI challenge represents only 20% of the effort, the remaining 80% involves the much more complex task of connecting AI models to the disparate data sources, legacy systems, APIs, and organizational knowledge that exist across isolated silosâ€”making data accessibility and integration the true bottleneck in delivering practical AI value

> Without a framework like Solace Agent Mesh, connecting AI systems to siloed data sources can be extremely complex, requiring custom integration code and pointing to point connections resulting in maintenance challenges.
