## What is the Solace Platform – and Why It Matters in AWS Solutions

The [Solace Event Platform](https://solace.com/products/platform/) is a cloud-native, enterprise-grade event streaming and management solution designed to help organizations move data in real time, across any environment, at any scale. It gives enterprises the ability to wire together applications, devices, and services through events, no matter where they live — on-premises, in AWS, or in other public or private clouds.

In the [context of AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=9572c0d6-3f30-4189-aa2e-2db363830711), Solace acts as the connective tissue for event-driven solutions. It provides the agility to plug AWS into the broader enterprise event fabric, ensuring data flows seamlessly between AWS services and the rest of the organization’s ecosystem — whether that’s ERP systems in data centers, SaaS applications hosted elsewhere, or workloads running in another hyperscaler.

## Why This Matters in AWS

AWS has a powerful set of native services for messaging, streaming, analytics, and integration — including Amazon MSK, Kinesis, EventBridge, SQS, and SNS. Each of these is excellent at its specific job. But when an architecture spans regions, geos, hybrid cloud or multi-cloud, connecting those pieces together and ensuring consistent, reliable data movement quickly becomes complex.

Solace simplifies that problem by giving customers one consistent platform to:

- Ingest data into AWS from on-premises core systems, edge sites, SaaS apps, or other hyperscalers with minimal friction.
- Distribute data across AWS services such as Lambda, S3, Redshift, and EventBridge with guaranteed delivery, fine-grained filtering, and replay when needed.
- Extend event-driven patterns across multiple AWS accounts and regions, while also linking to non-AWS environments — without requiring separate products or custom integration glue.
The Event Mesh Advantage

At the heart of Solace is the [concept of an event mesh](https://solace.com/solutions/initiative/event-mesh/) — a dynamic, distributed fabric that automatically routes events across regions, clouds, and systems. In an AWS solution, this means events can travel:

- From on-premises directly into EventBridge to trigger serverless workflows.
- From another cloud provider into AWS to synchronize data or kick off downstream processes.
- Across AWS accounts and regions, without requiring developers to manage complicated cross-account plumbing.
Enterprises no longer need to deploy many specialized products or stitch together point integrations. With Solace, the mesh takes care of event routing, protocol translation, filtering, and governance.

### The Value for AWS Customers 

By [complementing](https://solace.com/solutions/technology/aws/) the depth of AWS services with Solace’s reach across enterprise boundaries, organizations can:

- Accelerate time-to-value by spending less time on integration wiring and more time delivering new experiences.
- Simplify their architecture, replacing multiple overlapping products with a single, unified platform.
- Future-proof their systems, seamlessly onboarding new applications, regions, or cloud providers without costly rework.
- Empower distributed teams with a common event backbone that enables scalable, real-time data movement enterprise-wide.
In short: AWS provides the building blocks, and Solace provides the connective fabric. Together they enable a true enterprise-grade event-driven architecture — one where AWS is the center of innovation, but never isolated from the rest of the hybrid, multi-cloud world.
