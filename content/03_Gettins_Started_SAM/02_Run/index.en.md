After initializing your Solace Agent Mesh instance, you will find out the following files and directories has been created in your project folder

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ .sam
â”œâ”€â”€ configs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ agents
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main_orchestrator.yaml
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ gateways
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ webui.yaml
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ logging_config.ini
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ shared_config.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
```

Here is a quick explanation on what this folder structure reflects: 

- `.env` - Contains environment variables used for configuration flexibility across different environments. Such variables include API keys, LLM endpoints, and any secret needed and accessed by the agent runtime. Note that when solace agent mesh runs, it injects the contents of this file to the agent runtime thread. 

- `.sam` - This directory contains framework-specific settings such as plugin configurations

- `config` - Houses all configuration YAML files for your SAM project, organized into several key components such as agents, gateways,logging settings, and common configuration settings shared across all agents and gateways (e.g. broker connection settings, model definitions, and service configurations)

> The shared configuration file employs YAML anchors (& and *) for referencing common elements throughout the configuration structure.


**Key Configuration Files**

`main_orchestrator.yaml`

This file configures the main orchestrator agent, which manages tasks and coordinates workflows between agents.

`webui.yaml`

This file configures the web user interface gateway, which provides a browser-based interface for interacting with the agent mesh.

**Configuration Management**

- Each configuration file defines one or more applications that can run independently
- The SAM framework supports agent applications, gateway applications, and plugin applications
- Configuration files are automatically generated by commands like `sam add agent`, `sam add gateway`, or `sam plugin add`
- You can run individual configuration files using sam run <config-file>
